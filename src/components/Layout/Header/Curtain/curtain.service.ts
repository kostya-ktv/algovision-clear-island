     * The algorithm removes all islands from the map.
        An island is two or more points on the map 
        that touch horizontally or vertically.

        Here is an example map:
        [
            [1,0,1,0,1],
            [0,0,1,0,0],
            [0,1,1,1,0],
            [1,0,1,0,0],
            [1,0,1,0,0]
        ]
        
        Expected output:
        [
            [1,0,0,0,1],
            [0,0,0,0,0],
            [0,0,0,0,0],

            [0,0,0,0,0]
